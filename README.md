# Week 1 Skills Portfolio and Professional Software Development Tools


## Week 2 Choosing Stack, HTTP and Rest

### Assessment 2 - Take an Online Course

In preparation for week 2, I've kicked off the journey with 3 courses on Lynda.com: (1) Full-Stack JavaScript Development: MongoDB, Node and React; (2) Node.js Essential and revised (3) Learning Git and GitHub. 

Node.js Essential is a very hands-on course with a good coverage of Node.js as a server-side solution and some of its core modules and concepts including the HTTP module. What I like about this particular course is the fact that it covers a wide range of Node.js core modules not just HTTP, unlike some of its peer courses. 

Here is the progress status as at the 29th of July 2018
